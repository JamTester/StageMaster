# StageMaster: A forced UAC POC.

THIS IS NOT A UAC BYPASS.

This forces the user to accept a UAC Prompt.

Features: 
* Forced UAC.
* Isn't dependent on it being a certain name nor in a certain directory.
* Undetectable.
* Gives any program admin rights.
* Cleans up most files dropped.

   
Future Features
        
* Request will look like it is from the display driver.
* Will cleanup all files dropped.
* HIDE THE DAMN POPUPS

Problems:
* Doesn't work in a VM. (I have no idea why)
